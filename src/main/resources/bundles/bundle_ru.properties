understand open issue on github.\n\

you defined bulldozer and kamikaze rank and want to combine them to into one rank. In this rank you would write \
"linked":["kamikaze","bulldozer"]. Rank will not work properly if you do not provide already defined rank names. \
rank can also have its own quests.\n\
pets - Pets can be defined like this : "pets":["some pet","uwu"]. This setup will spawn two pets attracted and controlled \

player witch suppose to get pet joins.\
